# Portfolio
Hello and welcome, I am a scientist and data analyst for a consulting firm out of Charlotte North Carolina. I am utilizing much of my free time to honing my HTML, CSS, and JS. As much as I enjoy the logic involved in JS, HTML and CSS has piqued my interest. There certainly is a science behind understanding and applying HTML/CSS to a website, which outputs a well-structured/functional page; however, there is a subjective aspect of it I am really enjoying. Perhaps it’s because I’m far from being an artist, but the challenges of applying CSS to a page, making it ascetically pleasing, and having confidence in my work as it comes together, has brough me much satisfaction. I am slated to attend a full stack bootcamp, through UNC Charlotte, on January 19th, 2022. I am excited to have finally found the resolve I needed to begin this awesome quest in becoming a developer. I expect the journey will be arduous, revealing, and enjoyable. Being a scientist and full-time father/husband commands much of my waking hours as it is. However, I know that putting my head down and relying on grit will propel me to my first development position. If you have taken the time to read this, I sincerely give you my thanks. Time is a finite resource, which should be used with discretion. Thank you
